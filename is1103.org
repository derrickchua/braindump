** Methodology
1. Identify a practice involving cybertech, or a controversial feature
   - Disclose hidden/opaque features
   - Assess descriptive components of ethical issues via sociological implications
   - Analyze normative elements, determine if guidelines/policies can resolve the issue
2. Analyze ethical issue by clarifying concepts and situating it in context
   - If a policy vacuum exists, go next substep, if not go to step 3
   - Clear up any conceptual muddles involving policy vacuum
3. Deliberate on ethical issue
   - Apply one or more ethical theories to the analysis
   - Justify the position you reach via sound logical analysis

Moral systems are evaluated against standards called /principles/.

Morality is:
1. Public
   - Rules are public
   - Everyone is obligated to partake in a moral system
2. Informal
   - Has no formal authoritative judges presiding over it
3. Impartial
   - Moral rules are ideally designed to apply equitably to all participants
4. Rational
   - The system is based on principles of logical reason
** Values
1. Instrumental
   - Provide external benefit (eg. computers etc)
2. Intrinsic
   - Valued for their own sake (eg. life, happiness)
