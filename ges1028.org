* Sociological Perspective
Defined as seeing the general in the particular
 - Child birth: Education, use of contraception
 - Suicide: Strength of social ties vs individualistic societies
* Global Perspective
Study of the larger world and our society's place in it. Logical extension of sociological perspective.
 1. High-income countries: 64 nations, including USA.
    These generate the majority of goods and services, people here own the most wealth.
 2. Middle-income countries: 73 nations
    People as likely to live in rural villages as developed countries. Considerable social inequality.
 3. Low-income countries: 57 nations
    Low standards of living. Majority struggle to get by: hunger, unsafe water etc.

Why we care:
- Where we live shapes the lives we lead
- Societies globally become increasingly interconnected
** Benefits of the sociological perspective
- Assesses the truth of common sense
- Helps us see opportunities and constraints in our lives
- Empowers us to be active participants in our society
- Helps us live in a diverse world
** Origins of sociology
Changes in Europe during 18th nadn 19th century:
1. Factory-based economy
Workers becoming part of an anonymous labour force, weakening traditions that had guided community life.

2. Growth of cities
"Enclosure movement": fencing off of areas for diferent purposes. Social problems such as air pollution.

1. Political changes
New ways of thinking: Hobbes, Adam Smith and John Locke.
Philosophers now spoke of things like /personal liberty/ and /individual rights/.

August Comte coined the term /sociology/ in 1838, and saw it as a product of 3 phases:
1. Theological
Religious view that society expressed God's will
2. Metaphysical (Renaissance: 15th Century)
Society was a natural rather than supernatural phenomenon
3. Scientific
Rise of science, headed by Newton, Einstein and other scientists.
Scientific approach used to analyze society.

Positivism: Use of "positive" facts as opposed to mere speculation
** Sociological Theory
Translating observations into understanding
Theory: Statement of how and why specific facts are related
Three theoretical approaches
*** Structural-Functional Approach
Framework for building the theory that sees society as a complex system whose parts work together to promote solidarity and stability.
Social structure: any stable societal pattern.
Analyze these structures and their consequences for the operation of society as a whole.
Robert K Merton distinguished between:
1. Manifest functions: recognized and intended consequences of social patterns
2. Latent functions: unrecognized and unintended consequences

Social dysfunction: social patterns that disrupt the operation of society
*** Social-conflict approach
Framework for building the theory that sees society as an arena of inequality that generates conflict and change.
Used to reason about social/wealth/racial inequality etc.
*** Gender-conflict approach
Feminism, gender inequaltiy
*** Race-conflict approach
POV that focuses on inequality and conflict between people of different racial and ethnical categories
*** Symbolic-interaction approach
Framework for building the theory that sees society as a product of the everyday interactions of individuals
We live in a world of symbols, and attach meaning to everything

Summary in last two pages of reading week 1
* History in Singapore
- PAP hostile towards history in 1960s and 1970s. 
- ‘Before you discuss your future,’ Lee Kuan Yew exhorted the citizens of
Singapore in 1998, ‘remember how we got here.’
- nostalgia for the 1970s was an inherent criticism of the fast pace of change and goals of the state.
- PAP's rule under threat: but capitalized it, harnessing history for nationalist aims
- History is a trope of knowledge, an established way of thinking about society and as such is critical to understanding a society.
- The failure of Singaporean society to theorize, or come to terms with, its own past, constitutes opaqueness in the study of Singapore.
** Singaporean Histography
- First written by colonizers
  - Sir Thomas Stanford Raffles(1781 - 1826) autobiography: /A memoir of the Life of and Public Service of Sir Thomas Stanford Raffles/. Published 1824.
  - Expansion of historical work happened closer to national independence (around 1960s)
  - Similar to HK, where waning of colonialism results in the exploration of their history.
** Elite Representations
- Large part of Singapore's history told in terms of the life of LKY.
- Texts are attempts to build a "national mythology", conflates national history with personal.
- Biography and autobiography provide an incomplete picture of a national history.
- Political biographies and autobiographies of LKY reinforce the national narrative.
- Inclusion in national education curriculum
- The function of Lee’s autobiographies is broader than the writing of a national narrative, because the autobiography actively participates in the construction of a national imaginary.
- 'Even from my sick bed, even if you are going to lower me into the grave and I feel that something is going wrong, I will get up.' - LKY
- Lee is very much a product of colonialism, educated in a British tradition. He is often described as ‘a Chinese mirror of the perfect Anglo leader’.
- S Rajaratnam and Devan Nair "midwives of the Singaporean nation-state". Set the template for writing of history in the future.
- Nair
  - Looking to the past for inspiration was both dangerous and backward.
  - Industrialization/modernization divided people into those who look to the past and those who look to the future.
- Sourcing for historical material is hard: bias, difficulty of dating pre-colonial material.
- Censorship by Singapore Government
- Low profile makes it hard to attract academics to work in historiography
- The way in which a nation constructs its history can be integral to the construction of the nation itself. 78 The relationship between history and the nation in Singapore is polemical because of the state’s changing attitude towards the past.
- Rajaratnam’s 1970s statement that ‘knowing where you are going is more important than knowing where you came from,’ 79 and Lee Kuan Yew’s aforementioned proclamation of 1998, ‘Before you discuss your future, remember how we got here’
- Education policies concerned with mother-tongue language learning and the inclusion of Confucian values in the moral education curriculum are part of this desire to cultivate Singapore as an inherently ‘Asian’ nation.
- Threat and struggle are the two dominant themes the PAP promotes in its understanding of Singapore’s history, and events and issues are manipulated to fit with this model
** Nostalgia
Rather than censoring such responses, the Singaporean state responded to the rise in nostalgia by trying to co-opt it for nationalist purposes. In
transforming nostalgia from something that could potentially undermine the policies and rhetoric of development, to a positive part of a broader and
multilayered nation building project, the state is acting in a typically adaptive mode. In mainstreaming nostalgia, the state effectively moved nostalgia away from the 1970s and broadened its meaning.
 ‘Friends and Family: A Singapore Album collection’ is both a virtual interactive web-based exhibition and a traditional museum exhibition. Encouraged to contribute to the collective Singaporean Identity
** Summary
With numerous strategies the Singaporean state attempts to control the meaning of history in Singapore. The past is presented by methods of display, content and absences, as uncontested and unproblematic. The historiography mirrors this. The history that the state constructs and manipulates ratifies the construction of cultural knowledge in Singapore, even when it is authored by. The more active role Singaporeans are playing as creators of historical knowledge has returned Singapore to a more traditional relationship with history. That is, the state is utilizing history as a form of nation building and as a way of negotiating a multiracial society. Instead of history presenting a threat to the fragile balance of a multiracial society, it is now a tool for bringing people together. In the shared experience of life in Singapore as well as the shared experiences of lives—births, marriages, celebrations, etc.—history has become a part of the national story. The state has been effective in widening the focus of nostalgia beyond the dangerous period of the 1970s, but as with other actions of adaptive regimes, as more is given to citizens the greater their potential demands become, and the greater the need for adaptation. In attempting to focus attention towards sites of nostalgia that are less problematic, especially the physical manifestation of buildings, the Singaporean state is still seeking to control the meaning of the past. An emphasis on heritage and the built environment freezes a historical moment and strips it of context. That is, the state is making heritage an object of the present and not the past. Likewise, ‘A Singapore Album’ and blog sites turn nostalgia into something that is contemporary not historical. In so doing the Singaporean state is simultaneously negotiating the production of historical knowledge and seeking to de-politicise history. If, as L. P. Hartley suggested ‘the past is a foreign country,’ 121 then making the past the present makes it less foreign.

* Lecture Summary
** Lecture 1
Topic: Introduction - Studying Singapore Society

Knowledge production and dissemination: Given that we are social actors born in a specific socio-political and historical context, we tap upon a range of sources of knowledge when we attempt to explain social issues or phenomena (e.g. low fertility rates; academic underperformance; etc.) These can be organised broadly as lay perspectives; and disciplined perspectives. However, there are approaches which are regarded more dominant than others. We considered how and why a particular perspective may emerge as dominant in a particular context and the key stakeholders interested in sustaining such dominance. 
Disciplined perspectives and the sociological imagination: To understand Singapore society beyond lay perspectives and the “commonsense”, the lecture introduced the framework of the “sociological imagination” (C.W. Mills). This broadly means we are able to go beyond the individual and connect “private” troubles to “public” issues (By extension, it is a quality of mind in making the connection between individual and society; biography and history; and self and the world). 
The global perspective: The global condition is an extension of the sociological imagination, which is important in view of the connectedness our lives to the world and the global structures that govern our lives.
Blaming the victim: Therefore, when we extend our analysis beyond the individual and look toward more holistic and long-term systemic conditions to explain specific social phenomena, we move away from a limiting approach which solely “blames the victim” (Ryan).   
** Lecture 2
Topic: Histories and the Past

Representations and politics of “the past”: Our lecture stressed that we are not overly preoccupied whether the past (both pre-colonial and colonial) is historically “accurate” or otherwise, but rather how particular narratives of the “past” have been represented as dominant. Therefore, the lecture also considered who produces history (the “authors”) and its relationship to power, ideology and the state. In other words, these narratives are produced to reinforce specific interests of groups who control power and resources.
Historical consciousness: The engagement of “historical consciousness” directs our attention to focus on the multiplicity of interpretations of “the past” to push the boundaries of historical knowledge. This means moving beyond history as a tool for propaganda to appreciate historical complexities and diversity/pluralism. 
** Lecture 3
Topic: State and Civil Society

Civil society and citizen participation: Our lecture attempted to critically analyse the extent to which active citizenship engagement on a range of different issues (e.g. the environment, women’s issues, LGBT and human rights, migrant workers, etc.) is rendered possible in Singapore. We differentiated between “civic” and “civil” society, and closely interrogated the role of the state in establishing legal, social and cultural boundaries pertaining to citizen participation.
Gestural politics and “resistance”: We also closely discussed the relevance of Lee’s concept of “gestural politics” in which he refers as essentially “pseudo-politics” primarily aimed at sustaining the appearance of a liberal democracy while simultaneously extending the power of the authoritarian state through legal and extra-legal mechanisms, despite calls to “inclusiveness” and active citizenship.   

Globalisation and the internet: The final part of the lecture emphasised the role of the internet and transnational alliances with civil society organisations beyond Singapore in an attempt to not only increase its reach to a wider audience, but more crucially to strengthen the authority and legitimacy of the different claims local civil society organisations were making.
* National Society of Singapore (NSS)
** Concept of Resistance
Ho (2002) Internet as the guidance
** Gestural Politics
Goh Chok Tong: political scientists started talking about GP
Just trying to project a liberal image
maintain power relations (keep the people happy), prevent regression
to oppressive society

Lee (2008) : How the state uses rhetoric ("openness", "inclusiveness")
as liberal gestures 
They are gestures because words lack substance
"Civic" vs "civil": Duties vs rights
** Background
- NGO, non-profit
- Mission: promote nature awareness and appreciation
- 1986: MNS:S discovered area around Sungei Buloh
- MNS-S prepared its first conservation proposal
- State planned for an agro-technology park in the area
- 1989: Sungei Buloh Nature park was founded

Sungei Buloh isolated success

Government planned to build a golf course at Lower Pierce Reservoir,
which was ultimately void

25,000 strong petition could not change decision to build housing area

2011, Bukit Brown cemetery. 8-lane highway to be constructed
diagonally across the Bukit Brown cemetery
- Economic Pragmatism vs Conservation
* Gestural Politics
(Rodan 2006)
- Promises of openness does not amount to democratic developments
- Define the parameters of politics and political participation in
  Singapore under LHL's charge.
  - mediate the meanings of political transformation in Singapore via
    creative institutional and gestural initiatives.
- Goh Chok Tong promised a kinder and gentler style of rule when he
  took office in 1990.
- "liberal gestures" continue to reproduce and mediate an illiberal regime.
- Goh's rule as prime minister (from 1990 to 2004) arguably became
  best known for the institution and entrenchment of the infamous
  out-of-bound markers
  - Golfing terminology intended to demarcate the parameters of
    political debate and dissent in Singapore
  - OB markers remain the most cited reason for political apathy among
    its citizens and the corresponding lack of public discourse on
    civil society and political issues in SG.
- PM Lee's decleration of greater openness under his premiership could
  be seen as the continuation of PAP's "regime reproduction"
  initiatives that are intended to steer "change in Singapore down a
  preferred path of /political co-option/ rather than /political contestation/".
- Speech peppered with "openness" nothing more than a public relations
  statement to project Singapore as a mature, progressive and creative
  society to the rest of the world.
- display of readiness to engage with "diverse views"
- LHL's rule since August 2004 typified by use of language and
  buzzwords that "seem long on rhetoric  but short on content"
- "openness" and "inclusiveness" are terms that can be invoked
  repetitively and as liberally as desired.
** Examples
1. 9 March 2004, Singapore Tourism Board (STB) launched "Uniquely
   Singapore"
   1. Comprising a range of media advertisements for different global markets
   2. Developed in the wake of SG's recovery from its economically
      crippling encounter with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
   3. Coincided with the circulation of broad rhetoric that speaks of
      a "more open" and "creative" Singapore.
   4. Vibrant place where locals and foreign talents can "live, work
      and play"
   5. Time Magazine, 1999, Singapore as "competitive, creative, even
      funky"; such inscriptions mark a form of radicalness that is
      intended to displace old mindsets about Singapore's colorless
      cultural landscape.
2. Fashionable rhetoric of "creativity", popularized by the Singapore
   government's decleration in 2002 that it would embrace the global
   "creative industries" project.
   1. overarching intention of creativity and innovation is to boost
      Singapore's economic capital by attracting talented individuals
   2. Productive energies of such "bohemian-creative" individuals
      would "rub off" on Singaporean workers.
3. Publicized changes have included:
   1. a declared willingness to appoint openly gay public servants to
      sensitive positions in civil service 
   2. Legalization of "bar-top" dancing in pubs and nightclubs
   3. Granting of permits for extreme sports such as skydiving
4. 2003, government has been busy liberalizing the city's nocturnal
   entertainment scene by allowing 24-hour "party zones" in night
   spots, along with a host of established hotels and clubs
5. Tolerance to difference, diversity and "acceptance" of alternative lifestyles
   1. LHL - panoramic vision of Singapore included "an expanded space"
      for Singaporeans to "live, laugh, grow and be themselves".
   2. Dimension and make-up of newly liberated space (like the
      invisible boundaries of the OB-markers), are likely to remain
      cryptic and ambiguous
   3. Policy changes affect minority of Singaporeans, but give PAP
      enough substance to push their "rhetoric"
6. "Great Casino Debate"
   1. Under GCT's rule, proposals for a casino in Singapore have been
      rejected since the 1970s
   2. Pushing for casino not straightforward, necessary to engage the
      citizenry by gathering feedback and guaging opinions
   3. 13 march 2004, Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister George
      Yeo delcared Singapore's new state of openness when he said in
      Parliament that the government would "/keep an open mind/" on
      whether to build a casino in Singapore.
   4. Religious groups dismayed at proposal, voiced strong objections
   5. Group of citizens calling themselves "Families Against the
      Casino Threat in Singapore" (FACTS)
   6. FACTS collected 20000 signatures through an Internet petition,
      to be submitted to President of Singapore.
   7. Most believed debate amounted to nothing but talkfest
   8. By Dec 2004, MTI received more than 700 letters, emails and
      faxes on the issue
* Race
** Demographics
- Chinese 74.1%, Malays 13.4%, Indians 9.2%, Others (3.3%) - Singapore Census 2010
- CMIO classification
** Race as Colonial Legacy
- Singapore is a product of Western colonial capitalism
The idea of meritocracy is never enforceable in practice beacuse
social advantage is not equally distributed
** Cultural Logic of SG's Multiracialism
1. Heightened racial consciousness
2. Stereotypical thinking to reinforce racial differences
3. Top-down
